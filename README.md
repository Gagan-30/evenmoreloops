ITERATION – COUNT CONTROLLED LOOPS
Convert each of the following pseudocode segments into programs. Run each to see how the different count controlled loops work.
Each loop requires different variables. Read the pseudocode carefully to identify the variables.
1.		for turn = 1 to 10 step 1
    print( “Go”)
next

2.		for turn = 1 to 10 step 1
    print( turn)
next

3.		for turn = 5 to 20 step 1
    print( turn)
next

4.		for turn = 1 to 12 step 1
    print(turn * 5)
next

5.		START = 5
FINISH = 15
for turn = START to FINISH step 1
    print( turn)
next

6.		for turn = 15 downto 5		(Hint: what is the step?)
    print( turn)
next

7.		for j = 1 to 12
    for k = 1 to 12
        print( j*k)
    next
next

8.		The following pseudocode totals the numbers from 1 to 100
total = 0 
for count = 1 to 100
    total = total + COUNT
next
print( total)
Convert the pseudocode to Java.

9.		Alter your program to permit the user to enter the beginning and end numbers and then total them.
For example if the user enters 5 and 11, the program will output the sum of: 5+6+7+8+9+10+11

10.		Write a program to display a series of numbers. The program must ask the user for the START number, the COUNT and the INTERVAL. i.e. if START = 5, COUNT = 10 and INTERVAL = 3, the series would be 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32.

11.		The following pseudocode demonstrates how to select the largest of a group of input values. The user enters the rainfall for each of the 12 months of the year and the program (through the variable max_rainfall) records and outputs the largest value.
Convert the following pseudocode into Java.
max_rainfall = 0
for MONTH = 1 to 12
    rainfall= input()
    if(rainfall > max_rainfall) then
        max_rainfall = rainfall
    END IF
next
print( “The maximum rainfall for the year was “ + max_rainfall + “.”)

12.		Prepare pseudocode for the following:
•	Enter the scores for a team of 11 cricketers
•	Determine and store the highest and lowest scores
•	Calculate and output the average of all the scores
•	Display the highest, lowest and average scores

Once you think you have written a complete algorithm, convert your pseudocode to a functioning program.
